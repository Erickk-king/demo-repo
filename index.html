<i>1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,<p>2 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; <p>3 who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; <p> 4 being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.  <p>5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, <p>6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.  <p>7 And of the angels he saith,<p> 8 But unto the Son he saith, <p>9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; <p>10 And, <p>11 They shall perish; but thou remainest: <p>12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, <p>13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, <p>14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
